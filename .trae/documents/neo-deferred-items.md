# Neo Deferred Items — Resolution Map

> Companion to `neo-implementation-steps.md` (the 26-step roadmap).
> Purpose: track every Neo item that was DEFERRED during Steps 11-16, and map
> each to the step / follow-up where it will be resolved. The roadmap says WHAT
> to build per step; this doc says WHERE the deferred bits land.
>
> Maintenance: when a future step CLOSES a deferred item, move that item to the
> "Resolved" section (or delete it) and commit. Do not let this file silently
> drift from reality.
>
> Source of truth for each item's detail: the `ship-log.md` +
> `planning-context.md` in `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-04-implement-neo-step*/`.

Convention: "Pre-existing" = the bug existed before the step that surfaced it
(verified by git-stash baseline); it is NOT a regression. "Roadmap step" =
lands inside an existing step of `neo-implementation-steps.md`. "Derived step" =
a follow-up step NOT in the 26-step roadmap (e.g. Step 13b, optimizer-hardening).

---

## 1. Recommended sequencing (where the new slots go)

Insert these into the roadmap ordering:

1. **[OPT-HARDEN]** Neo optimizer-correctness micro-step — slot it **before or
   alongside Step 17**. **DONE (2026-07-04):** K1 FIXED via the FCP
   `ldloca-kill` (Neo-only, Legacy-neutral). Q-STRUCT + Q-LONG were NOT
   reproducible on current HEAD (probes pass) — left deferred with suspect
   locations pinned (see §3).
2. **Step 17 (Ref/out + ldloca/ldflda + stind/ldind)** — fold IN: `ldelema`
   (Step 16) and `constrained.`-on-VT (Step 13 area 3). The Step 17 Ref-Slot /
   byref / VT-address model is the prerequisite for both.
3. **Step 13b (CLR binding codegen + unified CLRMethod param layout)** — slot
   it **immediately AFTER Step 17** (so the byref/param model informs the
   layout). Closes: Step 13 areas 4-5, K2, K2-family. Highest-value follow-up
   (unblocks CLR value-type by-value params/return).
4. **Step 18 (value-type newobj + CLR newobj)** — fold IN: quirk-newobj-alias.
   (Step 18 already owns IL value-type newobj.)
5. **[CATCH-COMPLETE]** small follow-up (anytime after Step 15) — closes
   `CheckExceptionType`-NIE-for-non-CLRType.
6. **Opportunistic** (no fixed slot; handle when triggered):
   - peephole + PatchKind.IsinstResult (Step 15) — when a patch-infra step lands.
   - Stelem_I / generic-token Ldelem·Stelem / native Ldelem_I·U8 / multi-dim
     arrays (Step 16) — when a test or feature needs them.
   - cgt-un comment-nit (Step 15) — trivial.
   - catch-wrapper (Step 14) — not a bug (matches Legacy); revisit only if a
     real symptom appears.

## 3. Per-item detail

### D-LDELEMA — `ldelema` opcode (Step 16 -> Step 17)
Step 16 implemented Newarr/Ldelem/Stelem/Ldlen but deferred `ldelema`. Its only
consumers are `stind_*`/`ldind_*`, `fixed`, and `ref`/`out` params — all Step 17
(the unified 8-byte Ref Slot `(objectIndex, offset)`). `ldelema` is a no-op to
ship without those consumers (it would produce a ref nothing reads). Currently a
Step-tagged NIE. **Resolution (Step 17):** `ldelema` is implemented. For an IL value-type array
(ILTypeInstance[] with pre-instantiated elements, the Step 16 representation)
the arm resolves the element ILTypeInstance and parks it on mStack, encoding
`(elementMStackIdx, 0)` so stind/ldind (and the heap stfld/ldfld that the C#
compiler emits for `arr[i].field = v`) hit the standard IL-instance Primitives
path on that element instance. A CLR primitive-array `ldelema` still throws a
Step-17 NIE (deferred -- direct indexing covers that path). The addrAlias
coexistence decision: the Step 12 folding stays the fast path; Step 17 adds a
consumer-scan gate that evicts an alias dest (making its producer real) ONLY
when the dest's address escapes the folding window AND the dest register is not
reused for any surviving foldable (`_Inline`/`Initobj`) consumer -- purely
additive, so Steps 12-16 are untouched (72/0 preserved).

### D-CONSTRAINED — `constrained.`-on-value-type (Step 13 area 3 -> Step 17)
Step 13 deferred `constrained.` callvirt specialization on a value-type `this`
(`T.ToString()` where T:struct). Three blockers, all Step 17 territory: (1)
`ldarga`/`ldarga.s` unimplemented (Step 6 NIE -> Step 17 byref); (2) the
`Constrained` opcode has no runtime arm and is re-appended AFTER the callvirt
(`JITCompiler.cs:1763-1772`) so it cannot inform it; (3) the box-once/direct-call
lowering needs the value-type `this` address model (= Step 17). No green NeoStep
test exercises `constrained.` today (zero regression). **Resolution:** fold into
Step 17 (or a tiny "Step 13 area 3 completion" immediately after Step 17).

### D-13B — Step 13 areas 4-5 (-> new Step 13b)
Step 13 deliberately scoped down to areas 1-3 (then area 3 also deferred — see
D-CONSTRAINED). Areas 4-5 were deferred because they touch the CLR binding
generator and the Neo call ABI shared by EVERY CLR method call — the single
highest-regression risk in the roadmap. Bundling them with the frame-local
box/unbox mechanics would have made the diff unreviewable.
- **Area 4:** binding-codegen overhaul — `Unsafe.Unbox<T>` + direct-call mode,
  eliminate `WriteBackInstance`.
- **Area 5:** CLRMethod param region unified Neo slot layout — reuse
  `AllocateSlotForType`/`StackSlotInfo`; read params via non-generic
  `ReadNeo*` helpers by actual slot width; REMOVE the caller-temp-slot fallback
  in `Optimizer.Neo.cs` (~646-655); cover CLR struct by-value params, return
  values, instance-method `this`, generic CLR struct params.
**Resolution:** a dedicated `implement-neo-step13b` change. Recommended AFTER
Step 17 so the byref/param model informs the layout. This is the highest-value
follow-up — it also closes K2 and K2-FAM.

### K1 — FCP mis-propagates value-type Moves (Step 12b -> RESOLVED in OPT-HARDEN)
After `b = a`, FCP rewrote later `b.field` reads to `a.field` even AFTER
`a.field` was mutated, because FCP's kill condition (`Optimizer.FCP.cs`) only
checked a whole-register write, not a field write via `ldloca; stfld`. Real
`b = a; mutate(a); read(b.field)` was silently wrong.

**RESOLVED (2026-07-04, OPT-HARDEN):** the corrected root cause is that the
`Stfld_*_Inline` reaches the field indirectly through a `ldloca.s` address
handle, so its `Register1` is the address temp, not the source local (the
original "kill on stfld Register1" design was a no-op). The fix kills the
propagation on the `Ldloca`/`Ldloca_S` itself: when the addressed local
(`op.Register2`) equals the propagation's `xSrc` or `xDst`, kill it (taking an
address = potential mutation through it). Gated `#if ENABLE_NEO_MODE`
(Legacy-neutral, stash-verified). Regression test `NeoOptHardTest_K1_*`
(FAIL-on-HEAD -> PASS-after). See
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-04-implement-neo-opt-hardening/`.

### K2 / K2-FAM — Move-path boxed-ref CLR-VT-local (Step 12b / Step 13 -> Step 13b)
- **K2:** the Step 8 VT-by-value param copy reads a primitive-field VALUE as an
  mStack index -> `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. The call param-setup path uses
  `NeoCallParamMap`/`CopyNeoCallArguments`, not `Move_Vt`.
- **K2-FAM:** the Move path mis-handles scalar/constant -> boxed-ref CLR-VT-local
  assignment (reads an int as an mStack index). Blocks CLR-enum/struct LOCAL
  round-trip end-to-end.
Pre-existing. The Step 13 MINOR-1 Box/Unbox/Initobj fix is correct per the
boxed-ref representation but UNTESTABLE end-to-end until this is fixed (the
CLR-enum-local test is deferred). **Resolution:** Step 13b area 5 (unified param
layout + Move-path) closes both.

### Q-NEWOBJ — Newobj dest/arg aliasing after `newarr` (Step 16 -> Step 18)
`new T(intArg)` immediately FOLLOWS a `newarr` collides in the Call/Newobj
Push-scanning lowering. `new T(intArg)` alone (no array) works (TC7 green); the
collision is in the call/newobj lowering (Step 10/11 territory), 0 diff lines
added there by Step 16. Worked around in Step 16 TC4 via default-ctor + field-set.
**Resolution:** fold into Step 18 (which completes newobj paths incl. IL
value-type newobj), or a Step 10/11 revisit.

### Q-STRUCT — struct-local + field-mutation + element-read temp-renumber (Step 16 -> deferred)
A struct local, followed by a field mutation, followed by an element read, was
suspected to hit an optimizer temp-renumber quirk (BCP/copy-prop). **OPT-HARDEN
probe result: NOT reproducible on current HEAD** — 6 probes pass (incl. the exact
Step 16 TC5 array/mutation/read pattern + high-register-pressure variants); the
JIT shows the ldelem dest is correctly distinct from the source local. Suspect
location pinned (`Optimizer.BCP.cs:97-141` renumber) for recovery IF a
reproducing case surfaces. No fix shipped (a guessed fix to the shared pass would
be worse than none).

### Q-LONG — long default-zero compare (conv.i8) quirk (Step 16 -> deferred)
A long default-zero compare (involving `conv.i8` + compare) was suspected to
mis-evaluate. **OPT-HARDEN probe result: NOT reproducible on current HEAD** — 3
probes pass (array, scalar-local w/ register pressure, default-field); the conv
readers and I8 compare/branch arms read `*(long*)` correctly; `InferPrimTag`→
`_I8` widening is correct. Suspect location pinned (JIT branch
type-specialization / `AllocateLocalStackSpaces` 4-vs-8-byte overlap) for
recovery IF a reproducing case surfaces. No fix shipped.

### D-CHECKEX — `CheckExceptionType` NIE for non-CLRType catch types (Step 14 -> [CATCH-COMPLETE])
The shared engine's `CheckExceptionType` (`ILIntepreter.cs:5835`) throws NIE for
catch types that are not CLRType (i.e. an `ILType` catch clause). Neo catch
matching uses this shared path (Step 14 does NOT use the `isinst` opcode for
catch dispatch). So catching a thrown IL-typed exception into an `ILType` catch
clause is not yet supported. **Resolution:** small [CATCH-COMPLETE] follow-up to
extend `CheckExceptionType` for ILType catch types (Step 15's isinst/CanAssignTo
enables the assignability check). Anytime after Step 15.

### D-PEEP — `box T; isinst U` peephole + `PatchKind.IsinstResult` (Step 15 -> opportunistic)
The compile-time peephole (detect `box T; isinst U`, statically resolve) and the
generic-parameter `PatchKind.IsinstResult` patch-table entry were deferred because
**neither the fusion pass nor `PatchKind` exists in this codebase**. `box->isinst`
executes correctly via the two runtime arms (Step 15) without fusion, so this is
pure optimization (non-functional). **Resolution:** opportunistically, when a
patch-infra step lands (possibly related to HybridPatch, or a dedicated
optimizer-features step). Low priority.

### D-ARR — array-completion gaps (Step 16 -> opportunistic)
- `Stelem_I` is lowered (correct 3-register encoding) but has NO interpreter arm
  (Step-tagged NIE) — rare `IntPtr[]`/`UIntPtr[]` native-int store.
- generic-token `Code.Ldelem`/`Code.Stelem` and native `Code.Ldelem_I`/`Ldelem_U8`
  are not enumerated by JIT `Translate` -> JIT-time NIE; rare in C# output.
- multi-dimensional arrays: rank-1 only.
**Resolution:** implement the specific variant when a test or feature needs it.

### N-CGTUN — Cgt_Un divergence comment (Step 15 -> opportunistic)
The `Cgt_Un` arm's divergence comment names only the operand=sentinel case; the
symmetric source=sentinel case also diverges (same sentinel-collision class,
unexercised by the whole TestCases suite). Cosmetic. **Resolution:** one-line
comment tighten, anytime.

### N-CATCHWRAP — catch slot stores ILRuntimeException wrapper (Step 14 -> accept)
The Neo catch slot stores the `ILRuntimeException` wrapper (not the unwrapped
inner), which MATCHES Legacy exactly (`ILIntepreter.Register.cs:5327`). The
spec's "unwrapped" wording is loose. Not a bug. **Resolution:** accept; revisit
only if a real symptom appears (e.g. when isinst-on-caught-exception is exercised).

### N-TC2 — Step 14 TC2 asserts `e != null` (Step 14 -> resolved by Step 15)
Step 14 TC2 asserted `e != null` because the type-check-in-catch (`isinst`) was
Step 15. Step 15 has now landed isinst. **Resolution:** TC2 can be tightened to
assert the exception type/identity; opportunistic cleanup.

## 4. Resolved
- **K1** — FCP value-type-move mis-propagation. Fixed in OPT-HARDEN (2026-07-04)
  via the `ldloca-kill` (Neo-only, Legacy-neutral). See §3 K1.
